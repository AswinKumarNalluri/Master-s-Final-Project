A SMART HYBRID ENHANCED RECOMMENDATION AND PERSONALIZATION ALGORITHM USING MACHINE LEARNING
                        
                                ABSTRACT
In today’s age of streaming services, the effectiveness and precision of
recommendation systems are crucial in improving user satisfaction. This project
introduces the Smart Hybrid Enhanced Recommendation and Personalization
Algorithm (SHERPA) a cutting-edge machine learning approach aimed at
transforming how movie suggestions are made. By combining Term Frequency
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for content based filtering and Alternating
Squares (ALS) with Weighted Regularization for filtering SHERPA offers a
sophisticated method for delivering tailored recommendations.
The algorithm underwent evaluation using a dataset that included over 50
million ratings from 480,000 Netflix users encompassing 17,000 movie titles. The
performance of SHERPA was meticulously compared to traditional hybrid models
demonstrating a 70% enhancement in prediction accuracy based on Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) metrics during training, testing and validation phases.
These findings highlight SHERPAs capability to understand and cater to
users’ subtle preferences representing an advancement in personalized
recommendation systems.
